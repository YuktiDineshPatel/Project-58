  <p > My favorite character is Munmun Dutta, she plays role as babita Krishnan Iyer and lives in Gokuldham Society in Tarak mehta ka ulta chasmah show. She was born on 28 September 1987 in Durgapur, West Bengal. She is very beautiful, smart and intelligent. And she is most beautiful from all of character. She is my inspiration in my life. In 2020 she is 33 years old. And I hope she will never leave the show Tarak mehta ka ulta chasmah.</p>
